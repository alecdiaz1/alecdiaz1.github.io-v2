                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>As a UCI student who has to add/drop classes every quarter, UCI’s online enrollment system <i>WebReg</i>
                    has worried me more than once about whether or not I have actually succeeded in adding and dropping
                    classes. Additionally, I remember as a new UCI student, I had trouble understanding what certain
                    buttons and fields were for, and what menus I needed to use to accomplish my tasks. I performed user
                    research and redesigned WebReg to better fit user’s needs and expectations.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>WebReg serves a specific purpose to UCI students: to check their enrollment window, check their fee
                    status, and manage/view their waitlist and enrollment in classes. In its current form, it can be
                    confusing to accomplish basic tasks, especially for new students. Some of the issues include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cumbersome process to enroll and waitlist classes</li>
                    <li>Unused features</li>
                    <li>Confusing vocabulary</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row research section">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-md-offset-3 col-md-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-lg-6">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Since WebReg is exclusive to UCI, I interviewed four UCI students of three different class levels to
                    identify some of their pain points and one student from another university as an additional outside
                    perspective. This way, I could identify pain points from users of differing levels of familiarity
                    with WebReg.
                </p><br>
                <p>I asked a series of seven open-ended questions and asked the interviewees to rank WebReg’s current
                    features based on their importance. Through this, I was able to learn about some of the issues the
                    students commonly face with WebReg in addition to findings that contradicted my original assumptions.

                <h2>Key Quotes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>“We can check fee status? I’ve literally never clicked on it.”</li>
                    <li>“You have to go back to the main menu so many times.</li>
                    <li>“The part for dropping/adding/changing classes can get a little confusing, especially since you
                        have to copy and paste the class number.”</li>
                    <li>“It’s pretty straightforward but slow.”</li>
                    <li>“More of the windows being available all on one screen would be helpful.”</li>
                    <li>“It's extremely cumbersome to find and plan courses.”</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h2>Synthesizing Data and Forming Insights</h2>
                <p>During the interview, I also asked the interviewees to rank WebReg’s current features on importance,
                    and if they knew what certain features did.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All of the interviewees did not know what the “change” feature does</li>
                    <li>60% of the interviewees did not know what “the “reset” button does</li>
                    <li>All of the interviewees listed add/drop class from enrollment and waitlist as their #1 task
                        when on WebReg</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Most of the users shared similar opinions in prioritizing tasks and similar emotional responses to
                    navigating WebReg and performing some actions. Some of the feelings that users associate with WebReg
                    included slow, simple, inefficient, normal, straightforward, and frustration.</p><br>
                <p>Combining the qualitative data and quantitative data from user interviews led to a few key insights:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Students are confused by the number of fields and buttons</li>
                    <li>Students are slowed down by the number of pages needed to do each task</li>
                    <li>Students do not use some of the current features</li>
                    <li>Some students find the process straightforward but cumbersome</li>
                </ul><br>

                <div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-md-offset-3 col-md-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-lg-6">

                </div><br>

                <p>Though most of the users found WebReg inefficient and slow, to my surprise, one user actually said
                    that it was simple and straightforward. While some users had different viewpoints on the usability
                    of WebReg, I found that all of the users did agree that some of the features were redundant and
                    confusing.</p><br>
                <p>
                    When brainstorming, I kept these responses in mind. I explored two different designs, trying to
                    reduce redundancy and increase the efficiency of all the features such as adding and dropping
                    classes, while still keeping the process straightforward.

                <p>
                    Overall, my goal was to increase efficiency and reduce redundancy in the interface. On the home page,
                    the student is able to see their fee status, enrollment window, and any recent notifications for
                    their classes. In doing this, I was able to remove two buttons and make notifications clearer.
                    Previously, notifications were very vague and said only "one or more of your classes has changed..."
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For adding and dropping classes, I simplified the process by introducing a search bar where a student
                    can just search for a class and add it instantly by clicking. This also removes the need for the
                    many of the buttons and options students previously said they never used. In addition,
                    the green box gives the student a positive or negative response depending on if they were
                    able to add the class.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    To drop a class or more than one class, a student only has to check off the boxes and click the
                    trash button, then confirm the deletion. The red box gives the student a notification that they
                    have successfully dropped the class.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Since my goal was to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency, I designed the interface to be simple
                    but functional. I believe my redesign is very effective because it greatly streamlines the entire
                    process of adding and dropping classes. Additionally, it gives the student clearer indication
                    on the status of the system after they perform an action. Due to time constraints, I did not
                    implement a weekly calendar feature that I had planned to do.</p>

                    Conducting real user research for the first time was a fun and rewarding experience. In the future,
                    I would try to get more users from diverse backgrounds for interviews. In addition, I would like to
                    try other user research methods such as focus groups. In conclusion, this exercise was a fun
                    introduction into user research and taught me more about what I need to incorporate into my design
                    process.
